    <p>
      <strong> Why are you taking this course? </strong><br>
      I want to learn how to code my own websites. I have mainly done backend coding in the past,
      so I'm also curious about frontend.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong> What experience do you have creating content for the web or programming? </strong> <br>
      I have used HTML, CSS, and javascript to create mini games. As well as using wordpress for creating websites.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong> What are your goals in this course? </strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li> Learn how to make a website from scratch
        <li> Learn UI/UX
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong> Learn computing - Command Line, Shell, Terminal, Bash </strong> <br>
      Command lines can be typed through terminals. Then the operating system will run and execute the command.<br>
      Each command prompt is noted with “$” at the beginning. To find out the username, we can simply type: “whoami” into the terminal, and it will return the username. <br>
      Commands can also be combined by using the double ampersand (&&) and this allows the terminal to execute more than one command at a time. <br>
      To navigate to different files, the common line “cd” can change the directory. <br>
      To see the current directory, the command “pwd” can be used. To show list of files stored under the directory,<br>
      “ls” can be used. Adding “-la” to the the back of “ls” will also show the hidden files and the data <br>
      last modified.The terminal can also be used as a text editor through the installation of Vim and Nano. <br>
      Simply using “vim” at the start of the file will open the file in text editing mode. To edit, press “i” on the keyboard. <br>
      Afterward press “ESC” and “:wq” to save and exit the editor.<br>
